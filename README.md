# tugsy
A surprise project for my fianc√©, who likes to watch the tugboats in Providence Harbor.

This is the app and GIS data for a single-use computer that gathers vessel NEMA data from a radio in our house and from online sources, then displays that data on a map. (It's also my first foray into a full C++ app, as well as my first app with any sort of extensive graphics code.) SDL2 is used to render to the screen and to handle touch events. It uses existing code that tunes/controls an SDR and transforms the data into position info.

There are two ways to interact with the app: the first, by touching the screen, displays information for the vessel under the touch; the second, by pressing a hardware button on the machine's frame, cycles through three pre-set views, one for PVD's inner harbor; from PVD to Bristol; and from PVD to the shipping lanes in Long Island Sound off Point Judith.

All of the data for land-based features come from OpenStreetMap data exports (see https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/41.6493/-71.5876); all of the data for maritime features comes from *our tax dollars at work*, a.k.a., NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (see http://www.charts.noaa.gov/InteractiveCatalog/nrnc.shtml).

The mainboard is this: https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/A20-OLinuXIno-LIME2-4GB/open-source-hardware

...and its screen/touch interface: https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/LCD/LCD-OLinuXino-7TS/open-source-hardware

...and the SDR: http://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/nesdr-mini-rtl2832-r820t.html

The enclosure for this is partly ready-made frame (see https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/LCD/LCD7-METAL-FRAME/) and partly laser-cut pieces of my own design. That frame is useful but ugly.

### Code organization
'**Tugsy**' is the main class and contains the main method. It also handles events. There are four other classes:

* **SdlState**, which manages the rendering context;
* **View**, which figures out which bits of screen and backgrounds should be changed;
* **PositionData**, which selects which positions (of the potentially hundreds received per second) should be displayed; and
* **Receiver**, which reads raw AIS/NEMA data from the radio and decodes them into positions and other information.

Tugsy's main method starts a thread for the Reciever and then rests in an event loop, which pulls collated position data from PositionData and hands them off to the View. The View uses the SdlState to do its rendering work. New positions are read from the radio on the order of hundreds per second (max) and the display is updated at about ten frames per second, or whenever one of the events described earlier has to be handled.
